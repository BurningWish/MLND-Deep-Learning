# Dog identification algorithm using Convolutional Neural Network

This is the 6th project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. This project uses deep learning, especially CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to develop algorithms to identify the dog's breed given a dog photo. Moreover, a human photo is supplied my algorithm will be able to detect it and predict the most resembling dog species that looks like this human.
